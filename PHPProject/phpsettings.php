To use the CitySDK Mobility Write API, you need a valid user account. For now, we only provide write access to a couple of selected organisations and data owners, but this will change soon. In the meantime, if you have data you think CitySDK desperately needs, you can send an email to Citysdk Support: citysdk@waag.org
